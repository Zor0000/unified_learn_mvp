This project implements an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using PostgreSQL + pgvector, LangChain, and OpenAI models. It replaces traditional fixed-size chunking with agentic chunking, where an LLM semantically segments documents into meaningful knowledge units enriched with structured metadata.
